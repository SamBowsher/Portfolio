## THIS IS CURRENTLY A WORK IN PROGRESS

You may be wondering why there are no games in here yet. This is because, as it stands, any games that I would put here are too big for GitHub Desktop, and I will need to install a seperate tool. Thanks, GitHub.

## Art

In the art folder, you'll find 3D assets in .fbx format that were modeled in Maya, a handful of pixelated sprites in .gif format, and some abstract art that I did in Adobe Illustrator in .png format. All of this is my original work.

## Games

This folder does not exist yet as I am having trouble uploading my games to GitHub. Please come back in a few weeks.

## Music

These are finished songs that I'm proud of. Two of them, I've actually used in games. I typically compose pieces that I intend to play in MuseScore, and pieces that I intend to use in games in Caustic 3.
